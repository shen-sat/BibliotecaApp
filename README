Welcome to Biblioteca!
=================================================
Biblioteca is a command-line app for browsing books in a virtual library.

Run app
=================================================
Once you've downloaded project from github:
cd ~/TWU_Biblioteca-master/out/artifacts/biblioteca_jar
java -jar biblioteca.jar

Instructions
=================================================
Press 1 to view a list of books.
Press 2 to quit app.

Design
=================================================
I've used Java to build this app. I've built a class each for the following entities:
- Menu
- Library
- ExampleBooks
- Book

The ExampleBooks class is for demo purposes. It builds a list of template books using the Book class. The Main class puts these template books into the Library. The Main class then launches the Menu. After a welcome message and instructions, the Menu takes in user input. Depending on the input, the Menu either displays the template books from the Library or quits the application.
